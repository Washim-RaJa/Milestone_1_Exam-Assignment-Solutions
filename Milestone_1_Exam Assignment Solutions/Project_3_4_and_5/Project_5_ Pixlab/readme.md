# Pixlab Landing Webpage Project
### An online service platform website clone for marketing and growth of Startup businesses.

This website design can be used for providing services like business growth and marketing for Startup businesses.

I have designed this "Pixlab landing page" as an assignment project for "PW Skills Web Development Course" using technologies which are mentioned below :-

- HTML
- Tailwind CSS

I have tried my best to add all necessary design features like :-

-  A proper navbar containing menu along with a log in and a sign up button.

- A header section containing introduction of the landing page.

- A main section containing all the necessary product descriptions, also a dedicated public review section.

- A footer containing a dedicated email form to connect with the customers more effectively and dedicated about section to share contact informatons and the necessary details of the webpage.

- Moreover, I have also added proper comments for better code readability and understanding.

## Requirements
- An internet connection is required for proper loading of fonts and icons that are used in this website clone.
