# Hospital Landing Webpage Project
## A website clone for hospital to provide medical services .

This website design can be used for providing medical services online.

I have designed this "Hospital landing page" as an assignment project for "PW Skills Web Development Course" using technologies like :-
- HTML
- CSS

I have tried my best to add all necessary design features like :-

-  A proper navbar containing menu along with a button.

- A header section containing introduction of the landing page and input form for appointment bookings.

- A main section containing all the provided service descriptions, pricing, FAQs etc .

- A footer containing a dedicated email form to connect with the patients more effectively and a dedicated about section to share contact informatons and the necessary details of the webpage.
 

- Moreover, I have also added proper comments for better code readability and understanding.

## Requirements
- An internet connection is required for proper loading of fonts and icons that are used in this website clone.
