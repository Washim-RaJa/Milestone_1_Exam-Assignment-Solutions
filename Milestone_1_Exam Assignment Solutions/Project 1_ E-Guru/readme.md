# E GURU Landing Webpage Project
## An online education platform website clone for online study .

This website design can be used for providing online education services.

I have designed this "E GURU landing page" as an assignment project for "PW Skills Web Development Course" using technologies which are mentioned below :-
- HTML
- CSS

I have tried my best to add all necessary design features like :-

-  A proper navbar containing menu along with a sign up button.

- A main section containing introduction of the landing page.

- A footer section containing all the provided service descriptions.

- This is a "Responsive Website" i.e. this website clone is designed for both desktop and mobile screens. 

- Moreover, I have also added proper comments for better code readability and understanding.

## Requirements
- An internet connection is required for proper loading of fonts and icons that are used in this website clone.
